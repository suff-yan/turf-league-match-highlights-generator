# turf-league-match-highlights-generator
This project aims to develop an automated football match highlight generation system leveraging computer vision and machine learning. The system will process raw video footage and output dynamic highlights that focus on regions of high ball activity, using object detection, tracking, and event detection algorithms. Key components include ball and player detection, motion tracking, and automated clip extraction.
Phase 1: Project Setup & Data Collection
Duration: 1–2 weeks
Objectives:
Define scope (e.g., highlight only ball-centric actions or also goals, passes, fouls).
Set up development environment.
Tasks:
Environment setup:
Python, OpenCV, PyTorch/TensorFlow
MoviePy, FFmpeg for video handling
Hardware setup:
GPU-enabled workstation or cloud GPU (AWS, GCP, or Azure)
Data collection:
Download football match datasets (SoccerNet, OpenFooty, etc.)
Extract relevant videos and frames
Optional: start annotating custom dataset for ball and player positions
Version control:
Git/GitHub repository with structured folders (data, models, scripts, outputs)
Milestones:
Development environment ready
Dataset acquired and organized
Phase 2: Ball & Player Detection
Duration: 2–3 weeks
Objectives:
Detect the ball and players in each frame with high accuracy.
Tasks:
Model selection & training:
Start with pre-trained models (YOLOv8, Detectron2)
Fine-tune on football dataset for ball and player detection
Video preprocessing:
Frame extraction
Resize, normalize, or enhance frames for detection
Evaluation metrics:
mAP (Mean Average Precision), precision/recall for ball and player detection
Milestones:
Model can accurately detect ball and players in sample videos
Performance metrics logged
Phase 3: Ball & Player Tracking
Duration: 2 weeks
Objectives:
Track ball and player movement across frames for highlight detection.
Tasks:
Tracking algorithm:
Multi-object tracking using Deep SORT, ByteTrack, or OpenCV trackers
Trajectory generation:
Maintain ball trajectory and regions of high activity
Visual validation:
Overlay tracks on videos to verify accuracy
Milestones:
Consistent ball and player tracking across entire match videos
Tracking data stored for downstream highlight detection
Phase 4: Highlight Identification
Duration: 2–3 weeks
Objectives:
Identify clips of interest based on ball activity and events.
Tasks:
Event detection:
Define “highlight zones” using ball density or player proximity
Optional: detect goals, shots, passes using heuristics or action recognition models
Clip extraction:
Automatically segment video based on detected highlights
Use FFmpeg/MoviePy for clipping and stitching
Evaluation metrics:
Temporal overlap with manually selected highlights
Number of false positives/negatives
Milestones:
Automated clips of high ball activity extracted
Clips validated for relevance
Phase 5: Post-processing & Visualization
Duration: 1–2 weeks
Objectives:
Produce polished highlight videos with optional overlays.
Tasks:
Overlay enhancements:
Ball trajectory lines, heatmaps, player bounding boxes
Audio/video merging:
Optionally integrate commentary or crowd sounds
Output formats:
MP4, GIF, or web-embeddable clips
Milestones:
Clean, viewer-ready highlight videos
Optional interactive dashboard for reviewing clips
Phase 6: Optional Advanced Enhancements
Duration: 2–4 weeks
Objectives:
Add intelligence and interactivity to the system.
Tasks:
Action recognition:
Detect passes, fouls, tackles, and goals
Use models like I3D, SlowFast, or Video Swin Transformer
Analytics:
Generate heatmaps of ball movement, player density, or high-activity regions
UI/UX:
Web or desktop dashboard for coaches or analysts
Milestones:
Intelligent, interactive highlight system ready for end-users
