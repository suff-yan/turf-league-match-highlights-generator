# Turf League Match Highlights Generator

This project aims to develop an **automated football match highlight generation system** leveraging **computer vision and deep learning**. The system processes **raw match footage** and outputs **dynamic highlights focusing on regions of high ball activity**, using **object detection, tracking, and event detection algorithms**.

## ðŸš€ Project Roadmap

### **Phase 1: Project Setup & Data Collection**
**Duration:** 1â€“2 weeks  
- Set up Python environment with OpenCV, PyTorch/TensorFlow, MoviePy, FFmpeg.  
- Configure GPU-enabled workstation or cloud GPU for deep learning.  
- Collect datasets: SoccerNet, OpenFooty, and custom annotated clips.  
- Organize data: raw videos, frames, and annotations.  
- Initialize Git repository with structured folders: `data/`, `models/`, `scripts/`, `outputs/`.  

**Milestone:** Environment ready and dataset collected.

---

### **Phase 2: Ball & Player Detection**
**Duration:** 2â€“3 weeks  
- Implement **ball detection** using color + shape or deep learning.  
- Implement **player detection** using YOLOv8 or Detectron2.  
- Preprocess video: frame extraction, resizing, normalization.  
- Evaluate detection performance: precision, recall, mAP.  

**Milestone:** Accurate detection of balls and players in sample videos.

---

### **Phase 3: Ball & Player Tracking**
**Duration:** 2 weeks  
- Implement **multi-object tracking** (Deep SORT / ByteTrack / OpenCV trackers).  
- Generate **trajectories** for ball and players.  
- Visualize and validate tracking performance.  

**Milestone:** Reliable tracking across video frames.

---

### **Phase 4: Highlight Identification**
**Duration:** 2â€“3 weeks  
- Define **highlight zones** based on ball density or player proximity.  
- Optional: detect specific events like goals, passes, or shots on target.  
- Extract **highlight clips** using FFmpeg or MoviePy.  
- Evaluate temporal accuracy of extracted highlights.  

**Milestone:** Automated clips of high ball activity generated.

---

### **Phase 5: Post-processing & Visualization**
**Duration:** 1â€“2 weeks  
- Overlay ball trajectories, player bounding boxes, and heatmaps.  
- Merge audio (commentary/crowd reactions) if available.  
- Export polished highlight videos in MP4 or GIF formats.  

**Milestone:** Viewer-ready, visually enhanced highlight videos.

---

### **Phase 6: Optional Advanced Enhancements**
**Duration:** 2â€“4 weeks  
- Implement **action recognition**: passes, tackles, fouls, goals using I3D or Video Swin Transformer.  
- Generate **analytics**: ball movement heatmaps, player density, high-activity zones.  
- Develop **UI dashboard**: interactive highlight review tool using Streamlit or Gradio.  

**Milestone:** Intelligent and interactive highlight system ready for end-users.

---

## **Tools & Libraries**
- **Computer Vision / Deep Learning:** OpenCV, PyTorch, TensorFlow, YOLOv8, Detectron2  
- **Tracking:** Deep SORT, ByteTrack  
- **Video Processing:** MoviePy, FFmpeg  
- **Dataset:** SoccerNet, OpenFooty, custom annotations  
- **Optional UI:** Streamlit, Gradio

## **Next Steps**
- Integrate detection, tracking, and highlight extraction into a single pipeline.  
- Fine-tune models on football-specific datasets.  
- Add sample videos and demo outputs to GitHub for showcase.
